# Exponent Strategy Vaults

Run your own yield operation on Solana with full on-chain transparency. Exponent Strategy Vaults give you a permissioned execution environment where every capital movement is governed by policies you define, enforced by the Solana runtime, and visible to your depositors in real time.

Everything below describes what you control as a vault manager — from strategy selection to risk parameters to fee structures.

## Strategy Deployment

Capital in an Exponent vault is deployed into external yield protocols through a Squads-based smart account execution layer. Every strategy interaction must match an on-chain policy before it can execute. Vault managers can:

- **Select yield protocols:** Deploy capital into approved lending and yield protocols through policy-gated instructions.
- **Define allowed instructions:** Policies specify exactly which program instructions the vault is permitted to call, down to the instruction discriminator level.
- **Constrain accounts:** Policies can require specific accounts to be present in each transaction, preventing unauthorized target changes.
- **Set spending limits:** Per-period caps on token movement restrict how much capital can be deployed in a given timeframe.
- **Enforce timelocks:** Introduce mandatory delays between strategy approval and execution.

Without a valid matching policy, no capital movement is possible. The policy layer is enforced entirely on-chain.

## Risk Controls

Exponent vaults are designed with multiple layers of operational safeguards:

- **Policy constraints:** Every strategy execution is validated against on-chain policies that whitelist specific programs, instructions, and accounts. No capital can move outside of pre-approved parameters.
- **Spending limits:** Configurable per-period limits on token outflows prevent large, unauthorized deployments.
- **Emergency pause:** The Sentinel role can freeze vault operations immediately if market conditions deteriorate or a security concern arises.
- **Timelock buffers:** Parameter changes and new strategy approvals can be subject to enforced delays before taking effect, giving depositors time to react.
- **On-chain enforcement:** All constraints are validated by the Solana runtime. There are no off-chain components that can be bypassed.

## Role-Based Access

Vault governance is enforced through four distinct roles, each with scoped permissions:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Manager** | Full control — initialize the vault, add or remove policies, update strategy positions, manage all other roles |
| **Curator** | Add and configure token entries — define which assets the vault accepts and how they are priced |
| **Allocator** | Execute strategy interactions (deposits, withdrawals, borrows, repayments) within the bounds of approved policies |
| **Sentinel** | Emergency operations — pause or freeze the vault if needed |

Roles can be assigned to individual wallets or smart accounts. A single entity may hold multiple roles, but production vaults typically distribute them across separate parties.

## Depositor Experience

Depositors interact with vaults through a straightforward lifecycle:

- **Deposit:** Send supported tokens into the vault and receive LP tokens proportional to your share of total assets under management.
- **LP tokens:** Standard SPL tokens that represent proportional vault ownership. Freely transferable and composable.
- **Queued withdrawals:** Withdrawals are not instant. Depositors queue a withdrawal request, the vault manager fills it from available liquidity, and the depositor then executes to receive their tokens.
- **AUM-proportional:** LP token value appreciates as vault AUM grows through yield accrual from deployed strategies.

The queued withdrawal model ensures vault managers maintain control over liquidity allocation without forcing immediate liquidation of strategy positions.

## Fees & AUM

Vault AUM is computed on-chain as:

```
total_aum = idle_liquidity + deployed_position_value
```

- **Idle liquidity** is the sum of all tokens sitting in vault escrows that have not been deployed into a strategy.
- **Deployed position value** is the sum of all tokens held in strategy positions — token accounts, Kamino lending obligations, and orderbook positions — valued in base units using oracle pricing.

Prices are read from the Exponent Prices account, an on-chain oracle aggregator. Each accepted token has a price configuration that defines how its value is derived, supporting both simple price feeds and composite (multiply) pricing for derivative assets like LP or receipt tokens.

### LP Token Pricing

When a depositor deposits tokens, the LP tokens they receive are calculated as:

```
lp_tokens_received = (deposit_amount × total_lp_supply) / total_aum
```

LP tokens are standard SPL tokens. Their value appreciates proportionally as AUM grows through yield accrual. Vault managers can set a maximum LP supply to enforce a hard deposit cap.

### Fee Structure

Vault managers configure a treasury fee rate in basis points. This fee accrues in LP tokens to the vault treasury. The fee rate is stored on-chain and readable from the vault account at any time, giving depositors full transparency into the cost structure before they deposit.

## Supported Protocols

<Note>
**Currently available:** Only **Kamino Lending** is supported in the vault SDK today. The protocols listed below as "Coming soon" are planned for future releases — the on-chain vault program supports them, but SDK tooling is not yet available.
</Note>

| Protocol | Status | What it provides |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Kamino Lending** | Available | Lending and borrowing across multiple markets (MAIN, JLP, ALTCOINS, ETHENA, JITO, and more). Supports deposit, withdraw, borrow, and repay |
| **Marginfi** | Coming soon | Lending positions across USDC, SOL, mSOL, and other assets |
| **Jito Restaking** | Coming soon | Liquid staking and restaking yield |
| **Perena** | Coming soon | Stablecoin pool yield |
| **Generic** | Coming soon | Extensible adapter supporting Meteora, Adrena, Fragmetric, Sanctum, Jupiter Perps, and more |

Additional protocol integrations can be added through the policy system without requiring changes to the core vault program.
