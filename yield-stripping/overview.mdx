The Exponent Yield Stripping protocol separates yield-bearing assets into their principal and yield components on Solana. By decomposing a single yield-bearing position into a [Principal Token (PT)](/home/learn/principal-token) and a [Yield Token (YT)](/home/learn/yield-token), the protocol enables fixed-rate and leveraged yield strategies.

## How It Works

When a user deposits [SY (Standardized Yield Token)](/home/learn/standardized-yield), the protocol strips it into two tokens:

- **PT (Principal Token)**: Redeemable for the underlying asset at maturity at a 1:1 ratio
- **YT (Yield Token)**: Represents the yield component. To earn yield, YT must be deposited into a yield position — simply holding YT in your wallet does not accrue interest.

The number of PT and YT minted depends on the current [SY exchange rate](/home/learn/standardized-yield#the-exchange-rate) $r$:

```
Strip:   1 SY   →   r × PT  +  r × YT
Merge:   r × PT  +  r × YT  →  1 SY
```

For example, if the SY exchange rate is 1.05, depositing 100 SY produces 105 PT and 105 YT.

At maturity:
```
PT  →  Redeem for underlying asset (1:1)
YT  →  Collect remaining accrued yield, then expires
```

<Warning>
YT does not earn yield just by sitting in your wallet. You must deposit it into a `YieldTokenPosition` account so the protocol can track your balance and the exchange rate at entry. See the [SDK Quickstart](/yield-stripping/sdk-quickstart) for the full deposit → stage → collect workflow.
</Warning>

## Strategies

- **Fixed rate**: Buying PT at a discount locks in a guaranteed return. See [PT: Principal Token](/home/learn/principal-token) for details.
- **Leveraged yield**: YT provides amplified exposure to variable yield. See [YT: Yield Token](/home/learn/yield-token) for details.
- **Pricing math**: For the formulas behind PT/YT pricing, implied APY, and fee decay, see [Pricing & Math](/home/learn/pricing-and-math).

## SDK Classes

The yield stripping SDK exposes two main classes:

- **`Vault`** — Loads market state and provides core instructions (strip, merge, initialize positions, collect interest)
- **`YtPosition`** — Manages a user's yield position (deposit/withdraw YT, stage yield, collect interest and emissions)
