title: Get Yield Position
description: Load and read a user's yield position
---

The `YtPosition` class represents a user's yield position for a specific vault. It tracks deposited YT balance, accrued interest, and emission rewards.

## Loading a Position

### By address

```typescript
import { YtPosition, Vault, LOCAL_ENV } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk";
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const vault = await Vault.load(LOCAL_ENV, connection, vaultAddress);

const ytPosition = await YtPosition.load(LOCAL_ENV, connection, positionAddress, vault);
```

### By owner

```typescript
const ytPosition = await YtPosition.loadByOwner(
  LOCAL_ENV,
  connection,
  wallet.publicKey,
  vault,
);
```

### Multiple positions for one owner

```typescript
const vaultAddresses = [vaultAddress1, vaultAddress2, vaultAddress3];

const positions = await YtPosition.loadAllByOwner(
  LOCAL_ENV,
  connection,
  wallet.publicKey,
  vaultAddresses,
);
```

## Reading Position State

```typescript
console.log("YT balance:", ytPosition.ytBalance);
console.log("Owner:", ytPosition.owner.toBase58());
console.log("Staged interest:", ytPosition.stagedInterest);
```

## Available Properties

| Property          | Type        | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ytBalance`       | `bigint`    | Amount of YT deposited in the position            |
| `owner`           | `PublicKey`  | Owner of the yield position                      |
| `stagedInterest`  | `bigint`    | Interest that has been staged for collection      |
| `selfAddress`     | `PublicKey`  | The yield position PDA address                   |
| `vault`           | `Vault`     | The associated vault instance                     |

## Refreshing State

```typescript
await ytPosition.reload(connection);
```

## Serialization

```typescript
const json = ytPosition.toJson();
```

Returns a `YtPositionJson` object with:
- `owner` — Owner public key as string
- `ytBalance` — YT balance as string
- `interest` — Interest tracker with `lastSeenIndex` and `staged`
- `claimableInterest` — Calculated claimable interest amount
- `emissions` — Array of emission trackers
- `vault` — Serialized vault state
