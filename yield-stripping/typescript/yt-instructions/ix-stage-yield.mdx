title: Stage Yield
description: Stage accrued yield before collecting interest or emissions
---

The `ixStageYield` method on the `YtPosition` class creates a transaction instruction that stages accrued yield. This computes earned interest and emissions based on the current SY exchange rate and moves them into the position's staged balance.

<Warning>
You must call `ixStageYield` before collecting interest or emissions. Without staging, there is nothing to collect.
</Warning>

## Usage

```typescript
import { Vault, YtPosition, LOCAL_ENV } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk";
import { Connection, Transaction, sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const vault = await Vault.load(LOCAL_ENV, connection, vaultAddress);
const ytPosition = await YtPosition.loadByOwner(LOCAL_ENV, connection, wallet.publicKey, vault);

const ix = ytPosition.ixStageYield({
  payer: wallet.publicKey,
});

const tx = new Transaction().add(ix);
const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [wallet]);
```

## Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type        | Description                           |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `payer`   | `PublicKey`  | Transaction payer (signer)            |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionInstruction` that reads the current SY exchange rate via CPI and updates the position's staged interest and emission trackers.

<Tip>
You can stage and collect in the same transaction by adding both instructions sequentially.
