description: Low-level instruction to withdraw liquidity and return PT and base assets separately

# createWrapperWithdrawLiquidityClassicInstruction

Withdraws liquidity from a CLMM market and returns PT tokens and base assets separately. This instruction removes the LP position, returns the PT component directly to the withdrawer, and redeems the SY portion for the underlying base asset. This is useful when the caller wants to retain their PT tokens rather than selling them.

## Usage

```typescript
import { createWrapperWithdrawLiquidityClassicInstruction } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-clmm-client";
import { PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";

const ix = createWrapperWithdrawLiquidityClassicInstruction({
  withdrawer: withdrawerKeypair.publicKey,
  market: new PublicKey("market..."),
  ticks: new PublicKey("ticks..."),
  tokenPtEscrow: new PublicKey("tokenPtEscrow..."),
  tokenSyEscrow: new PublicKey("tokenSyEscrow..."),
  tokenSyWithdrawer: new PublicKey("tokenSyWithdrawer..."),
  tokenPtWithdrawer: new PublicKey("tokenPtWithdrawer..."),
  tokenProgram: new PublicKey("TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"),
  marketAddressLookupTable: new PublicKey("lookupTable..."),
  syProgram: new PublicKey("syProgram..."),
  lpPosition: new PublicKey("lpPosition..."),
  systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  eventAuthority: new PublicKey("eventAuthority..."),
  program: new PublicKey("program..."),
  amountLp: 1_000_000n,
  redeemSyAccountsLength: 3,
});
```
