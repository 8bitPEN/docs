title: Withdraw Liquidity Classic
description: Withdraw an LP position and receive PT and base assets separately
---

The `ixWithdrawLiquidityClassic` method on the `MarketThree` class withdraws liquidity from the CLMM pool. Unlike `ixWithdrawLiquidityToBase` which converts everything to base assets, this method returns the PT and SY components separately — the SY portion is redeemed for base, while PT tokens are returned directly to the withdrawer.

## Usage

```typescript
import { MarketThree, LOCAL_ENV } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk";
import { Connection, PublicKey, Transaction, sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const market = await MarketThree.load(LOCAL_ENV, connection, marketAddress);

const { ixs, setupIxs } = await market.ixWithdrawLiquidityClassic({
  owner: wallet.publicKey,
  amountLp: 9_000_000_000n,
  lpPosition: lpPositionPublicKey,
});

const tx = new Transaction().add(...setupIxs, ...ixs);
const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [wallet]);
```

<Tip>
Use `market.getPtAndSyOnWithdrawLiquidity(position)` to preview the PT and SY amounts you would receive before withdrawing.
