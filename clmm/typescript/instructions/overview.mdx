# MarketThree Instructions

These are the instruction builders provided by the `MarketThree` class. They handle account resolution, address lookup tables, base token conversion, and CPI routing automatically.

<Tip>
For low-level control, see the [raw Codama-generated instructions](/clmm/raw-instructions/overview) which require manual account resolution.
</Tip>

## Setup

All instructions are methods on the `MarketThree` class. See the [SDK Quickstart](/clmm/sdk-quickstart) for installation and full setup.

```typescript
import { MarketThree } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk";

const market = await MarketThree.load(env, connection, marketAddress);
const { ixs, setupIxs } = await market.ixWrapperBuyPt({...});
```
