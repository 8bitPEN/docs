title: Get PT and SY on Withdraw
description: Calculate PT and SY amounts to be received when withdrawing liquidity
---

The `getPtAndSyOnWithdrawLiquidity()` method calculates the amounts of PT (Principal Token) and SY (Standardized Yield) that will be received when removing liquidity from a position.

## Usage

```typescript
import { MarketThree, LOCAL_ENV } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk";
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const market = await MarketThree.load(LOCAL_ENV, connection, marketAddress);

// Get withdrawal amounts for full position
const { totalPtOut, totalSyOut } = market.getPtAndSyOnWithdrawLiquidity(position);

console.log("PT to receive:", totalPtOut);
console.log("SY to receive:", totalSyOut);

// Get withdrawal amounts for partial position
const liquidityToRemove = position.lpBalance / 2n; // Remove 50%
const { totalPtOut: partialPt, totalSyOut: partialSy } = market.getPtAndSyOnWithdrawLiquidity(
  position,
  liquidityToRemove
);
```
