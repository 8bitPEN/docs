# Exponent Protocol

**Exponent** is a decentralized protocol on Solana that enables yield trading through yield stripping — the decomposition of yield-bearing assets into **Principal Tokens (PT)** and **Yield Tokens (YT)**.

## What is Exponent?

Exponent provides infrastructure for sophisticated yield strategies by separating yield-bearing assets into two tradeable components:

- **PT (Principal Token)**: Fixed-income exposure with guaranteed redemption value at maturity
- **YT (Yield Token)**: Pure yield exposure that captures all interest and rewards above the PT redemption rate
