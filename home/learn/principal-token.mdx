## What Is PT?

PT (Principal Token) is the fixed-rate side of a stripped yield position. Think of it as a zero-coupon bond: you buy it at a discount and redeem it at face value when it [matures](/home/learn/maturity). The discount you get is your fixed return — locked in at the moment you buy, regardless of what the underlying yield does afterward.

When [SY](/home/learn/standardized-yield) is [stripped](/home/learn/token-lifecycle), it splits into PT (capturing the principal) and [YT](/home/learn/yield-token) (capturing the variable yield). PT holders are completely insulated from yield fluctuations.

## Key Properties

- **Trades below face value** before maturity
- **Redeemable 1:1** for the underlying at maturity
- **Price appreciates** toward 1.00 as maturity approaches
- **Fixed yield** — insulated from variable rate fluctuations

## How the Discount Works

PT always trades at a discount that reflects the market's implied rate. The closer to maturity, the smaller the discount:

| Days to Maturity | PT Price | You pay for 1,000 PT | At maturity you receive |
|------------------|:--------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 180 | 0.95 | 950 SY | 1,000 SY |
| 90 | 0.975 | 975 SY | 1,000 SY |
| 0 (maturity) | 1.00 | — | 1,000 SY |

Buying 1,000 PT at 0.95 and holding to maturity nets you 50 SY profit — a fixed return locked in at purchase, no matter what happens to the underlying rate.
