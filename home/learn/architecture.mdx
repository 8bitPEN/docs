## Programs

Exponent consists of three Solana programs that you interact with through the TypeScript SDK.

| Program | What it does | SDK class |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **exponent_core** | Yield stripping — strip SY into PT + YT, merge back, manage yield positions | `Vault` |
| **exponent_clmm** | Concentrated liquidity AMM — buy/sell PT and YT, provide liquidity | `MarketThree` |
| **exponent_orderbook** | Limit order book — post offers at specific APY levels, market orders | `Orderbook` |

For deployed program addresses, see [Programs](/home/programs).

## How They Fit Together

- **exponent_core** is the foundation — it manages vaults, mints PT and YT, and handles yield positions. The other two programs depend on it.
- **exponent_clmm** and **exponent_orderbook** are two independent ways to trade PT and YT. They both call into core when a trade requires stripping or merging under the hood.
- You don't need to interact with these programs directly — the SDK wraps everything into simple method calls on `Vault`, `MarketThree`, and `Orderbook`.
