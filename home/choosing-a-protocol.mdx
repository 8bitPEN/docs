title: Choosing Your SDK
description: Pick the right Exponent SDK for your use case
---

Exponent has three core systems — **Yield Stripping**, **CLMM**, and **Orderbook**. Each serves a different purpose. Pick the one that matches what you're building.

## What are you building?

| I want to... | Use | |
|---|---|---|
| Split yield-bearing assets into PT + YT, lock a fixed rate, or get leveraged yield exposure | **Yield Stripping** | [Quickstart →](/yield-stripping/sdk-quickstart) |
| Swap PT/YT instantly at market price, or provide concentrated liquidity for fees | **CLMM** | [Quickstart →](/clmm/sdk-quickstart) |
| Place limit orders at a specific implied APY, with passive fills and YT yield accrual | **Orderbook** | [Quickstart →](/orderbook/sdk-quickstart) |

## Comparison

| | Yield Stripping | CLMM | Orderbook |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What it does** | Split yield-bearing assets into PT + YT | AMM for swapping PT and YT | Limit order book for PT and YT |
| **Execution** | Instant | Instant | Instant (market) or queued (limit) |
| **Pricing** | SY exchange rate | AMM curve (APY-based ticks) | Implied APY |
| **Price impact** | None | Slippage on large trades | None (limit orders) |
| **Fees** | Protocol fee on accrued yield | Dynamic swap fee (decays toward maturity) | Maker/taker fees (decay toward maturity) |
| **Best for** | Creating PT/YT positions | Fast swaps, providing liquidity | Passive strategies, precise APY targeting |
| **SDK class** | `Vault`, `YtPosition` | `MarketThree` | `Orderbook` |

## Quick SDK Examples

### Yield Stripping — strip base assets into PT + YT

```typescript
const vault = await Vault.load(env, connection, vaultAddress)

const ix = await vault.ixStripFromBase({
  owner: wallet.publicKey,
  amountBase: 1_000_000n,
})
```

### CLMM — buy PT with base assets

```typescript
const market = await MarketThree.load(env, connection, marketAddress)

const { ixs, setupIxs } = await market.ixWrapperBuyPt({
  owner: wallet.publicKey,
  minPtOut: 950_000_000n,
  baseIn: 1_000_000_000n,
})
```

### Orderbook — post a limit order at a target APY

```typescript
const orderbook = await Orderbook.load(env, connection, orderbookAddress)

const { ix, setupIxs } = await orderbook.ixWrapperPostOffer({
  trader: wallet.publicKey,
  price: 0.12,              // 12% implied APY
  amount: 1_000_000_000n,
  offerType: OfferType.BuyYt,
  offerOption: offerOptions("FillOrKill", [false]),
  virtualOffer: false,
  expirySeconds: 86_400 * 7,
  mintSy: syMintAddress,
})
```
