description: Use Exponent's agent-friendly docs with Claude, Cursor, Copilot, and other AI coding tools
---

Exponent's documentation is built to be consumed by AI agents as accurately as by humans. AI coding assistants hallucinate API signatures when they don't have structured, current documentation. A single wrong parameter type in a Solana transaction means lost funds.

Exponent provides three machine-readable files that give agents exact method signatures, parameter types, and usage patterns — verified against the SDK source.

## Agent Files

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="llms.txt" icon="file-lines" href="/llms.txt">
    Structured index following the llms.txt standard — package info, program IDs, and links to every documentation section
  </Card>
  <Card title="llms-full.txt" icon="file-code" href="/llms-full.txt">
    Complete API reference with every method signature, parameter type, and return type across all SDK classes

    Operational knowledge file — setup pattern, decision tree, constraints, and common mistakes

## What Each File Does

### llms.txt

A structured index file following the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/). This is the first file an agent should fetch when working with Exponent.

**Contains:** package name, install command, all Solana program IDs, links to every documentation section, key classes and their load patterns, supported yield source flavors.

**How agents use it:** When an AI tool sees `@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk` in your codebase, it fetches `llms.txt` to understand what the SDK does and where to find details.

### llms-full.txt

The complete API reference — every public method on every class, with exact parameter names, types, and return types.

**Contains:** core concepts and formulas, every method on `Vault`, `MarketThree`, `Orderbook`, `Router`, `YtPosition`, `LpPosition`, full parameter signatures, return types, environment configuration, and utility exports.

**When to use:** When you need an agent to write a specific SDK call and want it to get the types right.

### skill.md

An operational knowledge file that turns an AI agent into a competent Exponent SDK user. Unlike `llms.txt` (an index) and `llms-full.txt` (a reference), `skill.md` teaches the agent *how to think* about Exponent.

**Contains:** setup pattern (exact imports and initialization code), decision tree mapping goals to classes and methods, constraints (CU limits, ALT requirements, YieldPosition initialization), common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Using with AI Tools

### Cursor

Add `skill.md` or `llms-full.txt` as a project-level doc in Cursor settings. Cursor will use it to generate correct SDK calls when you write Exponent code.

### VS Code Copilot

Download `llms-full.txt` to your project root. Copilot automatically includes workspace files in its context, so SDK method signatures will be accurate.

### Claude / ChatGPT

Paste the contents of `skill.md` into your conversation, or point the agent at the URL. The decision tree and constraints give the model everything it needs to write correct Exponent transactions.

## Best Practices

1. **Point your AI tool at `skill.md`** before starting an integration. This gives it the decision tree and constraints.
2. **Use `llms-full.txt` for reference calls.** When the agent needs exact parameter types, this file has them.
3. **Verify against the docs.** Agent output should match what's documented on the instruction pages.
4. **Add `skill.md` to your repo** as a reference file. All team members' AI tools will pick it up.
5. **Pin the SDK version.** `llms-full.txt` documents the current `@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk` API. If you use a different version, parameter types may differ.
