# createReallocOrderbookAccountInstruction

Builds a raw instruction to reallocate the orderbook account to accommodate more offers or data. This instruction increases the size of the orderbook account when needed.

<Note>This instruction can be called by anyone who is willing to pay for the additional rent. It does not require admin authority.</Note>

## Usage

```typescript
import { createReallocOrderbookAccountInstruction } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-orderbook-client";
import { PublicKey, SystemProgram, SYSVAR_RENT_PUBKEY } from "@solana/web3.js";

const ix = createReallocOrderbookAccountInstruction(
  {
    payer: payerPublicKey,
    orderbook: orderbookAddress,
    vault: vaultAddress,
