# Raw Instructions

These are the low-level instruction builders generated by [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) from the Exponent Order Book program IDL. They provide direct access to every on-chain instruction, requiring you to manually resolve all accounts and serialize arguments.

<Tip>
For most use cases, prefer the higher-level [TypeScript Instructions](/orderbook/typescript/instructions/overview) which handle account resolution, address lookup tables, and CPI routing automatically.
</Tip>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @exponent-labs/exponent-orderbook-client @solana/web3.js @solana/codecs
```

All raw instructions are imported from the generated client:

```typescript
import {
  createPostOfferInstruction,
  createMarketOfferInstruction,
  createRemoveOfferInstruction,
  // ...
} from "@exponent-labs/exponent-orderbook-client";
```
