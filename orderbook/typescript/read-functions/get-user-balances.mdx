The `getUserBalances` function retrieves the balances of PT, YT, SY, staked YT, and staged funds that a user has locked in the orderbook escrow for active orders.

## Usage

```typescript
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const balances = orderbook.getUserBalances(
  // The user's wallet public key
  wallet.publicKey
);

console.log("PT balance:", balances.pt);
console.log("YT balance:", balances.yt);
console.log("SY balance:", balances.sy);
console.log("Staked YT balance:", balances.stakedYt);
console.log("Staged balance:", balances.staged);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type        | Required | Description                  |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `user`    | `PublicKey` | Yes      | The user's wallet public key |

## Returns

Returns an object with the following balance fields (all as strings):

- `pt` - Principal Token amount held in escrow
- `yt` - Yield Token amount held in escrow
- `sy` - Standardized Yield token amount held in escrow
- `stakedYt` - Staked Yield Token amount
- `staged` - Staged funds available for collection

All balance values are returned as string representations of the token amounts in their smallest denomination (lamports). If the user has no escrow account, all balances will be "0".
