title: Get Withdrawable Funds
description: Determine which escrow balances can be withdrawn and how
---

Use `getUserBalances` to check what funds are available in your orderbook escrow and understand how to access each type.

## Usage

```typescript
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const balances = orderbook.getUserBalances(wallet.publicKey);

// These can be withdrawn directly with ixWrapperWithdrawFunds
console.log("Withdrawable PT:", balances.pt);
console.log("Withdrawable YT:", balances.yt);
console.log("Withdrawable SY:", balances.sy);

// This requires ixWrapperCollectInterest first
console.log("Staged interest (collect separately):", balances.staged);

// This is locked in active sell orders
console.log("Staked YT (in open orders):", balances.stakedYt);
```

## Understanding Each Balance

| Field | Withdrawable? | How to Access |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `pt` | Yes | `ixWrapperWithdrawFunds` with `ptAmount` |
| `yt` | Yes | `ixWrapperWithdrawFunds` with `ytAmount` |
| `sy` | Yes | `ixWrapperWithdrawFunds` with `syAmount` |
| `staged` | No | Use `ixWrapperCollectInterest` to transfer to your wallet |
| `stakedYt` | No | Remove the sell order first with `ixWrapperRemoveOffer` |

<Note>
`stakedYt` represents YT locked in active sell orders. Remove those orders first with [ixWrapperRemoveOffer](/orderbook/typescript/instructions/ix-wrapper-remove-offer) — the YT will move to `yt`, which is then withdrawable.
</Note>

<Tip>
`staged` interest must be collected via [ixWrapperCollectInterest](/orderbook/typescript/instructions/ix-wrapper-collect-interest) — it cannot be withdrawn with `ixWrapperWithdrawFunds`. Interest is paid in SY tokens.
</Tip>

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `user` | `PublicKey` | The trader's wallet public key |

## Returns

Returns an object with the following string fields (token amounts as strings):

- `pt` — PT tokens from filled buy orders, available for withdrawal
- `yt` — YT tokens from filled or removed orders, available for withdrawal
- `sy` — SY tokens from filled sell orders, available for withdrawal
- `stakedYt` — YT locked in active sell orders (not directly withdrawable)
- `staged` — Accrued interest from YT in orders (collect separately)
