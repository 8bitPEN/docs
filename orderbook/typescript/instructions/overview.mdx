# TypeScript Orderbook Instructions

These are the instruction builders provided by the `Orderbook` class. They handle account resolution, address lookup tables, base token conversion, and CPI routing automatically.

<Tip>
For low-level control, see the [raw Codama-generated instructions](/orderbook/raw-instructions/overview) which require manual account resolution.
</Tip>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @exponent-labs/exponent-sdk @solana/web3.js
```

All instructions are methods on the `Orderbook` class:

```typescript
import { Orderbook } from "@exponent-labs/exponent-sdk";

// Load an orderbook
const orderbook = await Orderbook.load(env, connection, orderbookAddress);

// Use instructions
const { ix, setupIxs } = await orderbook.ixWrapperPostOffer({...});
```
