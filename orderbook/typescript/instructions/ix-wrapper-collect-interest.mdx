title: Collect Interest
description: Collect accrued interest from open orders
---

The `ixWrapperCollectInterest` instruction collects accrued interest from YT held in open orders, as well as held from filled orders on the Exponent orderbook.

## Usage

```typescript
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const ix = await orderbook.ixWrapperCollectInterest({
  // The trader's wallet public key
  trader: wallet.publicKey,
  // The SY token mint address
  mintSy: syMintAddress,
});
```

## Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type        | Description                    |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `trader`  | `PublicKey` | The trader's wallet public key |
| `mintSy`  | `PublicKey` | The SY token mint address      |

## Optional Parameters

| Parameter         | Type        | Description                       |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `sySrc`           | `PublicKey` | SY token source account           |
| `tokenBaseTrader` | `PublicKey` | Base token account for the trader |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionInstruction` that collects accrued interest and transfers it to the trader's SY token account.

## How It Works

YT held in open orders continuously accrues yield. Interest is **staged automatically** during order fills and removals — you don't need to trigger staging manually. This instruction transfers the staged SY from your escrow to your token account.

Staged interest is tracked separately from your trading balances (PT, YT, SY). To withdraw trading balances, use [ixWrapperWithdrawFunds](/orderbook/typescript/instructions/ix-wrapper-withdraw-funds).
