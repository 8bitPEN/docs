description: A high-level technical introduction to the Exponent Orderbook
---

The Exponent Orderbook is a limit order program on Solana where PT and YT — assets issued by the Exponent Core program — are quoted using implied APY rather than spot asset prices.

## Implied APY Pricing

All orders on the orderbook are priced in **implied APY** rather than spot asset prices. The implied APY converts to PT and YT prices using the [continuous compounding formula](/home/learn/pricing-and-math). Buying PT at a discount locks in a fixed return; buying YT provides leveraged yield exposure.

## Order Matching

The orderbook uses a first-in-first-out (FIFO) matching engine. Orders at the same price level fill in submission order. All matching occurs fully on-chain.

## Shared PT and YT Liquidity

The orderbook supports shared liquidity between PT and YT through virtual orders. All orders are quoted in YT internally, including virtual orders.

To support PT orders, and therefore settle imbalances between PT and YT on the taker side, the orderbook executes atomic strip or merge operations:

- **Strip (SY → PT + YT)**: Converts SY to produce YT when matched orders result in net YT owed to takers
- **Merge (PT + YT → SY)**: Combines PT with YT to produce SY when matched orders result in net SY owed to takers

## Accounting for Interest in Open Orders

Yield generated by YT held in open orders is tracked by the orderbook. When selling YT, interest accrues while the order remains open. When buying YT, interest accrues after the order has been filled. In both cases, the accumulated yield remains claimable by the user.

## Fee Structure

The orderbook charges separate fees for makers and takers using a [time-weighted fee decay model](/home/learn/pricing-and-math#fee-decay-model). Maker fees are applied to limit orders when filled; taker fees are applied to market orders upon execution. Fees decrease as the market approaches maturity — at maturity, fees are zero and the market stops trading.

## SDK Class

The orderbook SDK exposes a single class:

- **`Orderbook`** — Loads orderbook state and provides all instruction builders (post offer, market offer, remove offer, collect interest, withdraw funds) and read functions (get quote, get user balances, get open orders)
