title: Vault Operations
description: Deposit, queue, and execute withdrawals from Exponent Strategy Vaults
---

The vault operations module covers the depositor-facing instructions for interacting with a Strategy Vault. These are the primary actions a user or integrator performs to move capital in and out of the vault.

## Flow

```
deposit → [vault grows AUM, strategy executions] → queueWithdrawal → executeWithdrawal
```

1. **Deposit** tokens into the vault → receive LP tokens
2. **Hold** LP tokens while the vault deploys capital and earns yield
3. **Queue** a withdrawal when you want to exit — LP tokens move to escrow
4. **Wait** for the vault manager to fill the withdrawal with the underlying tokens
5. **Execute** to burn LP tokens and receive your funds

<Note>
Withdrawals are not instant — they go through a queue that the vault manager fills before execution. This is by design to allow the vault to unwind strategy positions orderly.
