title: Vault SDK Overview
description: Architecture and key concepts of Exponent Strategy Vaults
---

The Exponent Vault SDK provides TypeScript tooling for interacting with **Strategy Vaults** — on-chain, policy-gated managed funds deployed on Solana.

Strategy Vaults sit alongside Exponent's core [yield stripping infrastructure](/home/learn/architecture). While the core protocol decomposes yield-bearing assets into PT and YT, Strategy Vaults pool depositor capital and deploy it into approved yield strategies through policy-gated execution.

<Note>
**Currently available:** The vault SDK supports interactions with **Kamino Lending** only. Support for additional protocols — including Marginfi, Jito Restaking, Perena, and generic adapters — is planned and will be added in future releases.

## What is a Strategy Vault?

A Strategy Vault (`ExponentStrategyVault`) is a multi-asset pool that accepts deposits, issues LP tokens to depositors, and deploys capital into approved yield strategies through a permissioned execution layer.

```
Depositors → [LP Tokens] → Vault → [Policies] → Strategy Positions (Kamino, Marginfi, ...)
```

Each vault maintains:
- **Token Entries** — a set of accepted tokens, each with its own escrow and price configuration
- **Strategy Positions** — tracked allocations to external protocols
- **Withdrawal Queue** — pending LP redemptions waiting to be filled and executed
- **AUM** — total assets under management computed as base liquidity + position valuations

## On-Chain Program

| Network | Program ID |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Mainnet | `HycecAnELpjL1pMp435nEKWkcr7aNZ2QGQGXpzK1VEdV` |

## LP Token Mechanics

When a depositor calls `depositLiquidity`, they send tokens into the vault's escrow and receive LP tokens proportional to their share of the total AUM.

```
LP out = (token_amount_in × total_lp_supply) / total_aum
```

LP tokens are standard SPL tokens and can be transferred freely. On withdrawal, LP tokens are burned and the depositor receives their proportional share back.

## Role-Based Access Control

Vault governance is enforced through four roles:

| Role | Permissions |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Manager** | Full control — initialize vault, add/remove policies, update positions, manage roles |
| **Curator** | Add and configure token entries |
| **Allocator** | Execute strategy interactions within approved policies |
| **Sentinel** | Pause or freeze the vault in emergencies |

## Policy-Gated Execution

All strategy interactions (deploying capital into Kamino, Marginfi, etc.) are executed as **Squads sync transactions** wrapped inside a vault policy. A policy defines:

- Which program can be called (`programId`)
- Which instruction can be executed (via discriminator `DataConstraint`)
- Which accounts must be present (via `AccountConstraint`)
- Optional spending limits per period

Without a valid matching policy, strategy execution is rejected on-chain.
